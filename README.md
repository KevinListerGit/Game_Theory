The model look at what happens with repeated negotations where the game total moves towards a maximum sustainable level.

It uses the prisoners dillema matrix and the probability of a player defecting increases as a linear function of the total game costs. 

Once the total game costs reaches the maximum sustainable level and there is no incentive to co-operate then the probability of defecting 
will be 1. 

Also, if a player suffers a competitive disadvanage then the new probablity of defecting increases as the his cost rises towards the maximum sustainable costs.

Game 7 shows what happens when three game are interconnected. In this case the total costs in one game can increase the total costs in another game, or if a player 
suffers competitive disadvantage in one game he will be at a further disadvantage in the other games. 

The output graphs show that a if one game is an a Nash Equilbrium, all connected games will be in a Nash Equilbirium. 

This is import in the real world, where the climate change, militrary security and economic competitiveness are closely linked interconnected games and it shows
that if one "game" or negotation is in a Nash equilbirum, where co-operation has broken down and been replaced with competition, then all other connected negotiations
will be in a Nash Equilbrium, and so no agreement can be reached. With all games locked in Nash equilbirums, the outlook for hummanity become very bleak.
